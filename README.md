## Journey
This project started as a personal endeavor to share my passion for space exploration and astronomy. Inspired by the wonders of the universe, I decided to build a blog to document and share my thoughts, knowledge, and discoveries with others who share the same enthusiasm.

Throughout this journey, I learned the power of Next.js and Tailwind CSS in simplifying the development process and creating visually stunning and responsive websites. Leveraging the flexibility of MDX, I could seamlessly combine Markdown with JSX and React components, allowing me to create rich and interactive blog posts. I also learnt the usage of fs to read the directory and access its content server side.

I hope this Space Blog serves as a valuable resource for fellow space enthusiasts, sparking curiosity and fostering a sense of wonder about the cosmos. Join me on this incredible journey as we explore the mysteries of the universe together!
